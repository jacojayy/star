----
- signed.apk is the winlator 10 version fork with native glibc and the one who is continued mainly.
- signed_rootfs-old is the winlator 10 version fork with native glibc and the one who is continued mainly and has the old rootfs prefix of winlator 10 that may heat up less.
- signed-benchproot.apk is the winlator 9 version fork with proot + benchmark package name that does not require the user to uninstall the normal winlator and speeds up the games in certain devices. this is not recommended as it can ruin your phone as its like doing a very long benchmark so be careful with this version.

# Troubleshooting
- If you are experiencing performance issues, try changing the Box64 preset to `Performance` in Container Settings -> Advanced Tab.
- For applications that use .NET Framework, try installing `Wine Mono` found in Start Menu -> System Tools -> Installers.
- If some older games don't open, try adding the environment variable `MESA_EXTENSION_MAX_YEAR=2003` in Container Settings -> Environment Variables.
- Try running the games using the shortcut on the Winlator home screen, there you can define individual settings for each game.
- To display low resolution games correctly, try to enabling the `Force Fullscreen` option in the shortcut settings.
- To improve stability in games that uses Unity Engine, try changing the Box64 preset to `Stability` or in the shortcut settings add the exec argument `-force-gfx-direct`.
